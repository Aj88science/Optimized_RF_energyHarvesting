# Optimized_RF_energyHarvesting
To create an efficient RF energy harvesting system, by implementing Multi band antenna design, genetic algorithm optimized parameters, MPPT algorithm based efficient power management and efficient rectification for harvested high frequency energy.
The fundamental idea is to 
1. Implement genetic Algorithm to optimize the design parameters for a micro-strip patch antenna.
2. Design and simulate the patch antenna based on the parameters provided after optimization.
3. Create a sample of antenna.
4. Implement an efficient rectifier circuit design for optimum power transfer.
5. MPPT algorithm implementation for overall system efficiency.
6. Analyze the overall system performance
